title: #DRAFT# Automated email reporting during the COVID-19 Pandemic (August 2020 - Present)  
---  

Aim: Reduce anxiety, stress, and misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic by providing consistent reporting in an easily digestible and accessible format. Take in feedback from end-users/consumers, identify areas of improvement. 

Introduction:
Data insights that are timely, accurate, and interpretable are hard to come by during a pandemic. In the initial wave of COVID-19 in New York City (April 2020), I found it overwhelming to parse through the new information being released and wanted to find a reliable source of data. In April, New York Times released their public ongoing repository for COVID-19 data for researchers and officials. Dashboards and visualizations were being built and released, but I didn't find them personable. Instead of a standing resource of high-level information to visit, I was looking for a tailored flow of consistent and reliable data points on the outbreak to be delivered to me, daily. This is where automated email reporting came into play!
