title: Automated email reporting during the COVID-19 Pandemic (July 2020 - Present)  
---  

**Aim:** Reduce anxiety, stress, and misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic by providing consistent reporting in an easily digestible and accessible format. Take in feedback from end-users/consumers, identify areas of improvement. 

**Introduction:**  
In New York City's first COVID-19 wave (starting April 2020), I was overwhelmed parsing through new information, news, and data being released about COVID-19. In April, New York Times released their public ongoing repository for COVID-19 data for researchers and officials. Dashboards and visualizations were built and released, but I didn't find them personable. Instead of a standing resource of high-level information to visit, I was looking for reliable data points on the outbreak to be delivered to me, daily. This is where automated email reporting came into play!

**Methods:**   
There were three main R scripts to:
- (1) Load and transform COVID-19 data from NYTimes and JHU. 
- (2) Compile tables and plots into report layout using RMarkdown
- (3) Email compiled report to recipients using Blastula package

**Lessons Learned:**
