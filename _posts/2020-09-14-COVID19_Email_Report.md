title: Automated email reporting to non-public health audience during the COVID-19 Pandemic

Aim: Reduce anxiety, stress, and misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic by providing raw data points in an easily digestible and accessible format.       

- Why use email?

Data, both timely and accurate, is precious during a pandemic. During the recent height of COVID-19 in New York City (April 2020), I found it energy intensive and stressful to parse through the sheer amount of information (volume & velocity), let alone it's value. I noticed there were many dashboards and visualizations being built during this time, but I didn't find them personable. Instead of a standing source of high-level information to visit, I wanted a tailored flow of consistent, reliable, raw data on the outbreak to be delivered to me.
