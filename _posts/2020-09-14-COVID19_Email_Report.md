title: CURRENTLY IN DRAFT: Automated email reporting during the COVID-19 Pandemic (August 2020 - Present)
---

Aim: Reduce anxiety, stress, and misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic by providing consistent reporting in an easily digestible and accessible format.        

- Introduction:

Data insights that are timely, accurate, and interpretable are a rare commodity during a pandemic. In the initial wave of COVID-19 in New York City (April 2020), I found it overwhelming to parse through all the information being released. From news article notifications to social media posts to daily podcasts to interviews with various experts -- the information was out there, but knowledge somehow didn't always feel like power. Sometimes it made you feel powerless. The recently coined term "doomscrolling" (the act of consuming a large quantity of negative online news, typically without pause, to the detriment of the mental health of the person consuming it - wikipedia) was what I felt. What I really was looking for--and as Governor Cuomo would say--was "just the facts." 

In April, New York Times released their public ongoing repository for COVID-19 data for researchers and officials. There were many dashboards and visualizations being built/released during this time, but I didn't find them personable. Instead of a standing resource of high-level information to visit, I wanted a tailored flow of consistent, reliable, raw data points on the outbreak to be delivered to me, daily. This is where email reporting came into play!
