title: Assessment of NYC's Child Mental Health Need using the CDC's Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) and the Child Opportunity Index (COI) in the context of COVID19
---

Aim: routing public health efforts and mental health resources to those areas of increased mental health need during COVID-19.

  > SVI data can be used to identify communities that will need continued support to recover following an emergency or natural disaster, and allocate emergency preparedness funding by community need.
