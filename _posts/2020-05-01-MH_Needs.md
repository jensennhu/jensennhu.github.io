title: Visualizing NYC's Community Vulnerability to COVID19 with the intent of Assessing Child Mental Health Need
---
Full working title: *Assessment of NYC's Child Mental Health Need using the CDC's Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) and the Child Opportunity Index (COI) in the context of COVID19*

Aim: routing public health efforts and mental health resources to those areas of increased mental health need during and after COVID-19.    
Why focus on the mental health needs of children?  

Traumatic events have long term impact on the social and economic fabric within our communities and influence the perception, development, and health outcomes of the youngest among us. COVID19 is a significant event that disproportionately uprooted (and continues to do so) lives of those in minority communities. From lives lost as a result of COVID19 infection to financial instability due to economic shut down to major disruptions in learning and education, the coronavirus pandemic is and continues to be a traumatic event in the lives of children today. As the future of our communities, children - especially those with existing socioeconomic disadvantages - need mental health resources to navigate the long term effects of this traumatic event. 

Why use the Social Vulnerability Index?

  > SVI data can be used to identify communities that will need continued support to recover following an emergency or natural disaster, and allocate emergency preparedness funding by community need. - CDC

Why use the Child Opportunity Index?

  > Neighborhoods matter for childrenâ€™s health and development... There is wide variation in child opportunity across metros but wider inequities occur within metros. Although metros are relatively small geographic areas, the opportunity gap for children is often as wide (or wider) within metros as it is across metros throughout the country. Within a given metro area, children who live only short distances apart often experience two completely different worlds of neighborhood opportunity. - diversitydatakids.org
